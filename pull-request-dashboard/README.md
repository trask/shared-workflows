# Pull Request Dashboard

A centralized shared workflow that builds and publishes a per-repository pull request triage dashboard for opted-in OpenTelemetry repositories. For each target repository, the workflow scans open PRs, classifies who has the next action, publishes the dashboard as a GitHub issue, and optionally sends Slack notifications.

The workflow runs from `open-telemetry/shared-workflows` and targets the repositories listed in [`repositories.json`](../.github/scripts/pull-request-dashboard/repositories.json). Target repositories do not need to host any workflow files.

Webhook-triggered incremental runs keep active dashboards close to real time. Hourly runs provide a backstop for missed or failed targeted refreshes.

The classification cache reuses prior results for unchanged review threads, minimizing Copilot token usage.

## Dashboard columns

The dashboard groups open non-draft pull requests by who is expected to act next (e.g. *Waiting on reviewers*, *Waiting on authors*, *Waiting on maintainers*, *Waiting on external*). Draft PRs are listed separately at the bottom unless `large_repo` rendering is enabled. Within each group, rows are sorted longest-waiting first. Every row has these six columns:

- **PR** — Pull request number and title, followed by any configured matching labels. The number autolinks to the PR on GitHub. Configured labels are rendered inline for both active and draft PRs.
- **Author** — GitHub login of the PR author.
- **Reviewers** — Reviewers who have engaged with the PR, each annotated with one or more icons:
  - ✅ approved
  - ✔️ approved (non-code-owner — does **not** count toward merge requirements)
  - 💬 has an open (unresolved) review thread on the PR
  - 📌 has tracked top-level feedback that still needs author action
  - 🔴 requested changes
  - Icons combine when multiple states apply. For example, 💬📌 means the reviewer has both an unresolved inline thread and tracked top-level feedback; ✅ may accompany either or both.
- **CI** — Aggregate check status across the PR's required status checks. Optional checks do not affect this column:
  - ✅ all required checks passing
  - ⏳ at least one required check pending, none failing
  - ❌ at least one required check failing
  - `?` check data could not be fetched
- **Conflicts** — Whether the PR has merge conflicts against its base branch:
  - ✅ no conflicts
  - ❌ has conflicts
  - `?` could not be determined
- **Age** — How long the PR has been waiting on the current next-action owner,
  not the calendar age of the PR. For example, a six-month-old PR that received a
  reviewer comment yesterday shows `1d` when it is waiting on the author. When
  possible, this is based on the oldest pending thread for the routed party;
  otherwise it falls back to the latest activity from the opposite party, then
  to recent PR activity or PR creation time. Format: `<1m`, `Xm`, `Xh`, or
  `Xd`.

## How to opt in

Open a pull request that adds your repository to [`.github/scripts/pull-request-dashboard/repositories.json`](../.github/scripts/pull-request-dashboard/repositories.json):

```json
[
  {
    "name": "example-repo",
    "approver_teams": ["example-approvers"],
    "required_approvals": 1,
    "author_follow_up": true,
    "non_blocking_check_patterns": [
      "markdown-link-check / link-check",
      "codecov/*"
    ],
    "labels_to_display": ["size/*", "breaking change"],
    "slack_channel": "#example-maintainers",
    "slack_user_mapping": {
      "octocat": "U0123456789"
    }
  }
]
```

Fields:

| Field | Required | Description |
| ----- | -------- | ----------- |
| `name` | yes | Name of the repository under `open-telemetry`. |
| `approver_teams` | yes | GitHub team slugs whose members count as approvers. |
| `required_approvals` | no | Number of approvals required for an open PR to be marked ready to merge. Defaults to `1`. |
| `labels_to_display` | no | Case-sensitive shell-style label name patterns to display inline after PR titles. Exact names such as `breaking change` and wildcard patterns such as `size/*` are supported. Defaults to `[]`, which displays no labels. |
| `non_blocking_check_patterns` | no | Check-name globs for non-required checks whose failures should be identified in the live PR status comment. When the PR is waiting on the author, matching failures are reported only when at least one required check is failing and are noted alongside those failures. On other routes, matching failures are shown separately. Matching checks remain informational and do not affect routing or the dashboard CI column. |
| `slack_channel` | no | Slack channel for notifications. Omit to skip Slack processing for this repository. |
| `slack_user_mapping` | no | Map of GitHub login to Slack user ID for at-mentions. |
| `large_repo` | no | If `true`, apply rendering presets that keep the dashboard body under GitHub's 65,536-character issue-body limit: cap each section (each *Waiting on …* table, the *Draft pull requests* table, and the *Diagnostics* block) at 100 rows, and omit the *Draft pull requests* section entirely. Truncated sections get a `_More X PRs not shown_` footer. Defaults to `false` (no cap, drafts shown). Enable this for very large repos with hundreds of PRs. |
| `author_follow_up` | no | If `true`, enable the once-per-PR author follow-up nudge. Defaults to `false`. |

`labels_to_display` only controls which labels are shown. It does not filter pull requests or affect dashboard routing, notifications, or status comments. All matching labels are displayed in the order returned by GitHub; a label matching more than one configured pattern is shown once.

Ask a maintainer or admin to add the repository under [Repository access](https://github.com/organizations/open-telemetry/settings/installations/133550497).

Once the PR is merged, the dashboard will pick up your repository on its next hourly run. To run it sooner, see [Manual dashboard run](#manual-dashboard-run). The dashboard issue is discovered dynamically in your repository by the `dashboard` label and `Pull Request Dashboard` title; if it does not exist, the publish step creates the label and issue.

## Review feedback lifecycle

Inline review threads and top-level feedback have different lifecycles on
GitHub. Top-level feedback means a standalone PR comment or submitted review
summary that is not attached to an inline review thread.

- An inline thread remains on the dashboard until someone marks the conversation
  resolved on GitHub or GitHub marks its code anchor outdated. An author reply
  can hand the dashboard action back to reviewers, but it does not close the
  thread. After addressing it, authors should reply with the outcome and, when
  appropriate, resolve the conversation. Author-only inline threads are treated
  as annotations rather than review feedback unless a non-author joins them.
- Top-level feedback has no resolved state. The dashboard therefore tracks each
  actionable top-level feedback item independently. 📌 means that one or more
  of those items are waiting on the author.
- Reviewer badges reflect GitHub's latest review state. A `CHANGES_REQUESTED`
  state affects only the reviewer's badge; it does not affect dashboard
  classification or routing. 🔴 remains until a later approval or dismissal
  clears that state. Empty review summaries are ignored; any inline comments
  are tracked through their own threads.

### Evidence for top-level feedback

For each actionable top-level feedback item, the dashboard identifies one or
more kinds of observable author evidence:

| Evidence | Used when the request asks for | Observable signal |
| -------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| `commit` | Code, tests, documentation files, or other repository changes | A later commit attributed to the PR author |
| `description` | A PR description update | A later description edit by the PR author |
| `title` | A PR title update | A later title rename by the PR author |
| `reply` | An answer, decision, clarification, or action without another tracked signal | A later standalone PR comment by the author |

A compound feedback item can require multiple evidence kinds. For example, a
request to change the implementation and update the PR description requires
both a later commit and a later description edit. One commit is sufficient
observable evidence for a request containing several code changes; the
dashboard does not try to prove that every requested edit appears in that
commit.

An explicit completed author reply addresses the item, even when another
evidence kind was expected. This lets authors explain why a suggestion was not
applied, ask a clarifying question, or otherwise close the dashboard action.
If the author instead commits to future work in the current PR, such as testing
or making another change later, the item remains waiting on the author.
The dashboard intentionally treats evidence as a handoff signal, not proof that
the reviewer agrees with the outcome.

Title and description edits are tracked separately, so a compound request can
require either or both.

### Routing after evidence

| Item | Before accepted evidence | After accepted evidence | When it clears |
| ---- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- | -------------- |
| Top-level author action | Waiting on the author; 📌 is visible | Addressed; 📌 disappears and normal approval-based routing resumes | Immediately after all expected evidence is observed, or after an explicit author reply |

GitHub remains responsible for enforcing blocking review states when a
maintainer attempts to merge.

This can hand a PR back to reviewers before every requested change is actually
complete, such as when an unrelated commit matches the expected evidence kind.
That handoff is deliberate: reviewers can see the activity and respond, while
the dashboard avoids leaving an active author indefinitely marked as blocked.

## Live PR status comment

After the first full dashboard run has populated repository state, each targeted
PR update creates or updates one dashboard-managed status comment on that PR.
The comment presents the time its status was last refreshed in UTC and a compact
**Waiting on** and **Next step** summary. The timestamp is refreshed on every
targeted PR update, even when the dashboard status is unchanged. When the author
has the next action, pending review feedback is summarized as a count and its
inline-thread and top-level-feedback links are nested under that next step,
followed by guidance for giving each item a clear outcome. When failing required
checks and feedback both need author action, the two are listed under **Next
steps**. At most 20 feedback links are shown across both groups; when more exist,
a note reports how many of the total are shown.
Draft PRs show that they are waiting for the author to move the PR out of draft
to request review.

A failing required status check routes a human-authored PR to the author ahead
of review and approval state. The live comment calls out required CI failures
explicitly and combines that reason with review feedback when both need author
action. When a repository configures `non_blocking_check_patterns`, matching
failed checks are named in a note alongside the required-check action when the
PR is waiting on the author because at least one required check is failing. On
other routes, matching failures are shown separately. Optional check failures
do not affect routing. Maintenance-bot PRs keep their
maintainer-oriented routing because the bot cannot act on a dashboard request.

A hidden marker lets the workflow update the comment in place and upgrade
existing one-time guidance comments rather than creating duplicates. Status
comments are refreshed automatically when their dashboard status or format
changes, including on inactive pull requests. Clear outcomes keep stale or
ambiguous feedback from being routed to the wrong person.

Reviewers should prefer inline comments for feedback requiring explicit
resolution. See
[`RATIONALE.md`](../.github/scripts/pull-request-dashboard/RATIONALE.md#top-level-feedback)
for the tradeoffs behind this behavior.

Targeted updates received before the first full dashboard run are ignored.

## Author follow-up nudge

Repositories with `author_follow_up` enabled use hourly runs to post a single
reminder. Manually triggered runs without a PR number do the same. Each run
evaluates the nudge only for PRs refreshed during that run. Since a repository
refresh is capped at 50 PRs, a due nudge in a larger repository may wait for a
later round-robin run, but it is delivered as soon as the PR is next refreshed.

Every PR routed to the author receives one nudge, one week after an eligible
follow-up run first observes it in *Waiting on authors*. The nudge links to the
dashboard-managed status comment and is mainly intended to point contributors
who are not yet familiar with that comment to the remaining items.

The nudge applies only while the PR is in *Waiting on authors*: if the PR leaves
that route before the week elapses, the clock resets. It is posted at most once
per PR, and a PR that has already been nudged is never nudged again even if it
leaves and later returns to *Waiting on authors*, including after it is closed,
drafted, or reopened.

## Configuration

The dashboard uses repository-scoped GitHub App access to read and update each
configured repository and to read approver team membership.

Slack notifications use the shared `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` secret. Each repository
can route notifications to its own `slack_channel` and map GitHub logins to
Slack user IDs via `slack_user_mapping`. Repositories without `slack_channel`
configured skip Slack notification processing. Scheduled Slack follow-ups are
also limited to PRs refreshed during the current hourly run, so a stale cached
route cannot produce a reminder.

## Prerequisites

The target repository GitHub App must be installed on your repository. Follow
the repository-access step under [How to opt in](#how-to-opt-in).

## Manual dashboard run

To run the dashboard manually, open the
[Pull request dashboard workflow](https://github.com/open-telemetry/shared-workflows/actions/workflows/pull-request-dashboard.yml),
choose **Run workflow**, and populate the `repository` field with the target
repository name under `open-telemetry`, for example
`opentelemetry-java-instrumentation`. Leave `repository` empty to backfill every
configured repository. Each run processes at most 50 PRs per repository; run it
again to continue through larger repositories without consuming the dashboard
App's hourly API quota in a single run.
