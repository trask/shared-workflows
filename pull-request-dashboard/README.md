# Pull Request Dashboard

A centralized shared workflow that builds and publishes a per-repository pull request triage dashboard for opted-in OpenTelemetry repositories. For each target repository, the workflow scans open PRs, classifies who has the next action, publishes the dashboard as a GitHub issue, and optionally sends Slack notifications.

The workflow runs from `open-telemetry/shared-workflows` and targets the repositories listed in [`repositories.json`](../.github/scripts/pull-request-dashboard/repositories.json). Target repositories do not need to host any workflow files.

Webhook-triggered incremental runs keep active dashboards close to real time. Hourly backfill runs provide a backstop for missed or failed targeted refreshes.

The classification cache reuses prior results for unchanged review threads, minimizing Copilot token usage.

## Dashboard columns

The dashboard groups open non-draft pull requests by who is expected to act next (e.g. *Waiting on reviewers*, *Waiting on authors*, *Waiting on maintainers*, *Waiting on external*). Draft PRs are listed separately at the bottom unless `large_repo` rendering is enabled. Within each group, rows are sorted longest-waiting first. Every row has these six columns:

- **PR** — Pull request number and title. The number autolinks to the PR on GitHub.
- **Author** — GitHub login of the PR author.
- **Reviewers** — Reviewers who have engaged with the PR, each annotated with one or more icons:
  - ✅ approved
  - ✔️ approved (non-code-owner — does **not** count toward merge requirements)
  - 💬 has an open (unresolved) review thread on the PR
  - 📌 has tracked top-level feedback that still needs author action
  - 🔴 requested changes
  - Icons combine when multiple states apply. For example, 💬📌 means the reviewer has both an unresolved inline thread and tracked top-level feedback; ✅ may accompany either or both.
- **CI** — Aggregate check status across the PR:
  - ✅ all checks passing
  - ⏳ at least one check pending, none failing
  - ❌ at least one check failing
  - `?` check data could not be fetched
- **Conflicts** — Whether the PR has merge conflicts against its base branch:
  - ✅ no conflicts
  - ❌ has conflicts
  - `?` could not be determined
- **Age** — How long the PR has been waiting on the current next-action owner,
  not the calendar age of the PR. For example, a six-month-old PR that received a
  reviewer comment yesterday shows `1d` when it is waiting on the author. When
  possible, this is based on the oldest pending thread for the routed party;
  otherwise it falls back to the latest activity from the opposite party, then
  to recent PR activity or PR creation time. Format: `<1m`, `Xm`, `Xh`, or
  `Xd`.

## How to opt in

Open a pull request that adds your repository to [`.github/scripts/pull-request-dashboard/repositories.json`](../.github/scripts/pull-request-dashboard/repositories.json):

```json
[
  {
    "name": "example-repo",
    "approver_teams": ["example-approvers"],
    "required_approvals": 1,
    "slack_channel": "#example-maintainers",
    "slack_user_mapping": {
      "octocat": "U0123456789"
    }
  }
]
```

Fields:

| Field | Required | Description |
| ----- | -------- | ----------- |
| `name` | yes | Name of the repository under `open-telemetry`. |
| `approver_teams` | yes | GitHub team slugs whose members count as approvers. |
| `required_approvals` | yes | Number of approvals required for an open PR to be marked ready to merge. |
| `slack_channel` | no | Slack channel for notifications. Omit to skip Slack processing for this repository. |
| `slack_user_mapping` | no | Map of GitHub login to Slack user ID for at-mentions. |
| `large_repo` | no | If `true`, apply rendering presets that keep the dashboard body under GitHub's 65,536-character issue-body limit: cap each section (each *Waiting on …* table, the *Draft pull requests* table, and the *Diagnostics* block) at 100 rows, and omit the *Draft pull requests* section entirely. Truncated sections get a `_More X PRs not shown_` footer. Defaults to `false` (no cap, drafts shown). Enable this for very large repos with hundreds of PRs. |

Ask a maintainer or admin to add the repository under [Repository access](https://github.com/organizations/open-telemetry/settings/installations/133550497).

Once the PR is merged, the dashboard will pick up your repository on its next hourly backfill run. To run it sooner, see [Manual backfill run](#manual-backfill-run). The dashboard issue is discovered dynamically in your repository by the `dashboard` label and `Pull Request Dashboard` title; if it does not exist, the publish step creates the label and issue.

## Review feedback lifecycle

Inline review threads and top-level feedback have different lifecycles on
GitHub. Top-level feedback means a standalone PR comment or submitted review
summary that is not attached to an inline review thread.

- An inline thread remains open until someone resolves it. Authors should reply
  with the outcome and/or resolve the thread after addressing it.
- Top-level feedback has no resolved state. The dashboard therefore tracks each
  actionable top-level feedback item independently. 📌 means that one or more
  of those items are waiting on the author.
- **Request changes** uses GitHub's blocking review state. 🔴 remains until a
  later approval or dismissal clears that state.

### Evidence for top-level feedback

For each actionable top-level feedback item, the dashboard identifies one or
more kinds of observable author evidence:

| Evidence | Used when the request asks for | Observable signal |
| -------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| `commit` | Code, tests, documentation files, or other repository changes | A later commit attributed to the PR author |
| `description` | A PR description update | A later description edit by the PR author |
| `title` | A PR title update | A later title rename by the PR author |
| `reply` | An answer, decision, clarification, or action without another tracked signal | A later standalone PR comment by the author |

A compound feedback item can require multiple evidence kinds. For example, a
request to change the implementation and update the PR description requires
both a later commit and a later description edit. One commit is sufficient
observable evidence for a request containing several code changes; the
dashboard does not try to prove that every requested edit appears in that
commit.

An explicit author reply always addresses the item, even when another evidence
kind was expected. This lets authors explain why a suggestion was not applied,
ask a clarifying question, or otherwise hand the decision back to reviewers.
The dashboard intentionally treats evidence as a handoff signal, not proof that
the reviewer agrees with the outcome.

Title and description edits are tracked separately, so a compound request can
require either or both.

### Routing after evidence

| Item | Before accepted evidence | After accepted evidence | When it clears |
| ---- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- | -------------- |
| Ordinary top-level feedback | Waiting on the author; 📌 is visible | Addressed; 📌 disappears and normal approval-based routing resumes | Immediately after all expected evidence is observed, or after an explicit author reply |
| **Request changes** review | Waiting on the author; 📌 and 🔴 are visible | Waiting on reviewers; 📌 disappears and 🔴 remains | A later approval or dismissal clears GitHub's change-request state |

This can hand a PR back to reviewers before every requested change is actually
complete, such as when an unrelated commit matches the expected evidence kind.
That handoff is deliberate: reviewers can see the activity and respond, while
the dashboard avoids leaving an active author indefinitely marked as blocked.

## One-time PR guidance comment

After the dashboard issue exists, the workflow adds one guidance comment to a
PR the first time a submitted review includes inline comments. A hidden marker
prevents repeat comments on later reviews or workflow runs.

The guidance asks authors to give each review thread a clear outcome and points
reviewers toward the feedback mechanism with the lifecycle they need. Reviewers
should prefer inline comments for feedback requiring explicit resolution. See
[`RATIONALE.md`](../.github/scripts/pull-request-dashboard/RATIONALE.md#top-level-feedback)
for the tradeoffs behind this behavior.

## Configuration

The target repository GitHub App is installed on each configured repository.
The workflow creates repository-scoped app installation tokens with
`PR_DASHBOARD_CLIENT_ID` and `PR_DASHBOARD_PRIVATE_KEY`, then uses those tokens for
API reads/writes and approver team membership reads in the target repository.

Slack notifications use the shared `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` secret. Each repository
can route notifications to its own `slack_channel` and map GitHub logins to
Slack user IDs via `slack_user_mapping`. Repositories without `slack_channel`
configured skip Slack notification processing.

## Prerequisites

The target repository GitHub App must be installed on your repository. See [`WEBHOOK_SETUP.md`](../.github/scripts/pull-request-dashboard/WEBHOOK_SETUP.md) for the GitHub App configuration this repo uses.

## State

Dashboard state is stored on the shared state branch configured by
`DASHBOARD_STATE_BRANCH`. State files are namespaced by target repository, for
example:

```text
semantic-conventions-genai/dashboard-state.json
opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/dashboard-state.json
```

This lets one central workflow manage multiple target repositories without
state collisions.

## Implementation

The workflow YAML and supporting scripts live in this repo:

- [`.github/workflows/pull-request-dashboard.yml`](../.github/workflows/pull-request-dashboard.yml) — top-level orchestrator
- [`.github/workflows/pull-request-dashboard-repo.yml`](../.github/workflows/pull-request-dashboard-repo.yml) — per-repository job
- [`.github/workflows/pull-request-dashboard-deploy-webhook.yml`](../.github/workflows/pull-request-dashboard-deploy-webhook.yml) — webhook bridge deploy
- [`.github/scripts/pull-request-dashboard/`](../.github/scripts/pull-request-dashboard/) — Python scripts, state handling, rendering

See [`RATIONALE.md`](../.github/scripts/pull-request-dashboard/RATIONALE.md) for the architecture and tradeoffs behind the design.
See [`WEBHOOK_SETUP.md`](../.github/scripts/pull-request-dashboard/WEBHOOK_SETUP.md) for GitHub App webhook permissions and dispatch setup.

## Manual backfill run

To manually run a dashboard backfill, open the
[Pull request dashboard workflow](https://github.com/open-telemetry/shared-workflows/actions/workflows/pull-request-dashboard.yml),
choose **Run workflow**, and populate the `repository` field with the target
repository name under `open-telemetry`, for example
`opentelemetry-java-instrumentation`. Leave `repository` empty to backfill every
configured repository. Each repository is subject to the PR cap so large repos
cannot consume the dashboard App's hourly API quota in a single run.
